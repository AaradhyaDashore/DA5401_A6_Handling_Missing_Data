***Name:** Aaradhya Dashore* <br>
***Roll No:** ME22B089*

## Tasks Performed
1. **Introduced Missingness:** Artificially introduced missing values into selected columns of the dataset.  
2. **Applied Four Imputation Strategies:**  
   - (A) Median Imputation  
   - (B) Linear Regression Imputation  
   - (C) Non-linear (KNN) Regression Imputation  
   - (D) Listwise Deletion  
3. **Standardized Features:** Scaled each dataset using `StandardScaler` fitted on the training set only.  
4. **Trained Logistic Regression Models:** Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for all datasets using consistent splits.  
5. **Compared Model Performance:** Analyzed trade-offs between imputation and deletion strategies and interpreted which approach worked best.

## Learning Outcome
> Learned how different imputation strategies impact downstream model accuracy and how to choose the most effective approach based on data characteristics.
